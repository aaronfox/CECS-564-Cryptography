House Will Vote Wednesday to Send Impeachment Articles, Pelosi Says
The speaker, who has waited nearly a month to transmit the charges against President Trump to the Senate, detailed her plan to move forward, allowing a trial to begin this week.
The House will vote on Wednesday to send the Senate impeachment charges against President Trump, allowing a long-awaited trial to begin, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats privately Tuesday, according to officials in the room.

The proceeding will be only the third time an American president has been put on trial in the Senate.

In a closed-door gathering with Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday morning, Ms. Pelosi detailed her plan to move on Wednesday to appoint the team of lawmakers who will prosecute the case against Mr. Trump, known as the House managers in his impeachment trial. The officials who described her private remarks spoke on condition of anonymity.

Unless things change, her timetable means that the House managers would ceremonially walk the articles of impeachment from the House chamber to the Senate well later in the day Wednesday, formally presenting them and prompting a trial to commence.
The speaker said she was not yet ready to share the names of the lawmakers she would select as managers, they said.
